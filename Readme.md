# Project Description

This is a short and simple calculator project written in Python serving as a refresher in Git config and command usage in maintaining a centralised codebase. 


### Further Goals for the Project:

* Refactor the code in order to allow more complex calculations as opposed to two numbers and an operand
* Display the project through a cleaner user interface as opposed to just the terminal look at Python libraries to provide this functionality potentially
